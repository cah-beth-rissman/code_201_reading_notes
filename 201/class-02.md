# Class 2

## Why this topic matters?
* Setting a firm foundation in HTML, CSS and JavaScript is important to me as I will continue to build on this information over the course. 

## HTML Text Fundamentals. HTML Advanced Text Formatting

* Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?
    * Semantic elements describe the meaning in both a human and machine readable way. Both the purpose and the type of content.
* How many levels of headings are there in HTML?
    * Six levels of headings are defined (H1-H6)
* What are some uses for the `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements?
    * Uses include, exponents, dates, formulas
* When using the `<abbr>` element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?
    * Plain text on first use, which infoms users of what the abbreviatio or acronym means.

## Learn CSS

* What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?
    * Three ways: internal stylesheet, external stylesheet and inline styles.
* Why should we avoid using inline styles?
    * If your site has more than one page it becomes less efficient to manage the styles. Styles may not be uniformly applied. 
* What is representing the selector?
    * The class or HTML element may both represet the selector. The CSS language has rules to control which selector is used. The rules are called cascade and specificity. 
* Which components are the CSS declarations?
    * Property and value pairs are the CSS declaration.
* Which components are considered properties?
    * In the example, color and padding are the properties.

## Learn JS

* What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?
    * String
* List 4 types of JavaScript operators.
    * Assignment `=` assigns a value to a variable.
    * Strict equality `===` performs a tewst to see if two values are equal. It returns a true/false (Boolean) result.
    * Not, Does not equal `!`, `!==` Returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a true into a false.
    * Additional `+` Add two numbers together or combine two strings.
* Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.
    * Alert when home thermometer reaches a specified temperature.

## Making Decisions In Your Code â€“ Conditionals

* An if statement checks a __ and if it evaluates to ___, then the code block will execute.
    * expression, true or not
* What is the use of an else if?
    * Allows user to create a chain of if statements
* List 3 different types of comparison operators.
    * Equal `==`
    * Not equal `!=`
    * Strict equal `===`
* What is the difference between the logical operator `&&` and `||`?
    * Returns expr1 if it can be converted to false; otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values, && returns true if both operands are true; otherwise, returns false.
    * Returns expr1 if it can be converted to true; otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values, || returns true if either operand is true; if both are false, returns false.

## Things I need to know more about
* shift + command + . to see hidden files on a Mac file finder

<!-- ## Lots of new JS prompts to play with 
    * Always start with 'use strict';
    * console.log('Hi, from the js file!');

// Prompt users for input
let userName = prompt('What is your name?');
console.log('User name is: ', userName);

// Validate the input usring some conditional logic
// if(meet this condition then do hte else){

// } else {

// }

if(toLowerCaseName === 'bob' || lowerCaseName === 'larry') {

alert('Welcome back to the site: ' + userName);
} else {
    alert('Welcome new user to my page!');
}

// userName.toLowerCase or the userName.toUpperCase(); 
let toLowerCaseName = userName.toLowerCaseName();

console.log('Name Lower Case: ', toLowerCaseName);

//look at some data types: boolean, string, number, undefined, null

let myBooleanValueTrue = true;
let myBooleanValueFalse = false;
let thirdBooleanValueTrue = true;

if

// introduction to arrays


// methods we are learning
// prompt(), typeof(), toLowerCase(), toUpperCase()

// technical requirements for lab -->
