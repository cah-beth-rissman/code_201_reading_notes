## Why this topic matters?
* Setting a firm foundation in HTML, CSS and JavaScript is important to me as I will continue to build on this information over the course. 

## HTML Text Fundamentals. HTML Advanced Text Formatting

* Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?
    * Semantic elements describe the meaning in both a human and machine readable way. Both the purpose and the type of content.

## Learn CSS

* What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?
    * Three ways: internal stylesheet, external stylesheet and inline styles.
* Why should we avoid using inline styles?
    * If your site has more than one page it becomes less efficient to manage the styles. Styles may not be uniformly applied.

    * The class or HTML element may both represet the selector. The CSS language has rules to control which selector is used. The rules are called cascade and specificity. 
* Which components are the CSS declarations?
    * Property and value pairs are the CSS declaration.

    * In the example, color and padding are the properties.

    * Not, Does not equal !, !== Returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a true into a false.
    * Additional + Add two numbers together or combine two strings.
* Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.
    * Alert when home thermometer reaches a specified temperature.

## Making Decisions In Your Code â€“ Conditionals

* An if statement checks a __ and if it evaluates to ___, then the code block will execute.
    * expression, true or not

* What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||?
    * Returns expr1 if it can be converted to false; otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values, && returns true if both operands are true; otherwise, returns false.
    * Returns expr1 if it can be converted to true; otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values, || returns true if either operand is true; if both are false, returns false.
