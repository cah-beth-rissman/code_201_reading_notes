## HTML Media
### Using Images In HTML. Read Common Image Types and Choosing Image Formats.

* What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?
  * Alt attributes help the visually impaired to interpret images used on a webpage.
* How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?
  * Add alt text to the image links added to your HTML. The Alt text is an alternative description of a picture or video if not properly displayed on your screen or if needed by a visually impaired person. 
* Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.
  * The figure tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc. While the content of the figure element is related to the main flow, its position is independent of the main flow, and if removed it should not affect the flow of the document. [Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure)
* Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.
  * A gif (graphic interchange format) and a svg (scaleable vector graphic) are diferent types of image formats. A gif format is not flexible to enlarge or generally change size. The contents of the image will be grainy or pixelated, similar to if you attempted to enlarge with a photocopier. As the name suggests, scaleable vector graphics are scaleable and are able to expand and contract while keeping image quality. 
* What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?
  * PNG, portable network graphics are designed for use on the internet and use image compression format on the web. They are not for printing or professional graphic images. 

## Learn CSS
### [Using Color in CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Applying_color)
### [Styling HTML Text Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals)

* Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.
  * Foreground defines the color of an element, such as the color of text. When writing your name with a black ink pen, the color of the text is black. Applying a background color is similar to taking a yellow highlighter and coloring over the black text of your signature. The yellow highlights are the background color of the element, in this case the background of the black text. 
* Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?
  * Add overall look and feel to website by adding a background color, add color to sections or individual blog posts to make them stand out and draw attention to the content, add a header and footer with color to draw attention to important information and links. 
* What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
  * Easy to read both in size and font type. Utilize headings to draw attention to important content. 
* What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?
  * Layout the content within the page as this is most important and then lead the user from there to less prominent headings and text for more details. 
* Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.
  * &nbsp - non-breaking space (add single space) or &ensp and &emsp (to add two or four spaces)
