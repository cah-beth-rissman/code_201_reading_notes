[Creating Hyperlinks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks)

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element? 
   1a. A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content, see Block level links, inside an <a> element and using the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.
2. The `href` attribute contains what information?
   2a. The web address and sometimes the title
3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
   3a. Add alt tags with comments

### [CSS Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout)

[CSS Layout: Normal Flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow)
[CSS Layout: Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning)

1. What is meant by "normal flow"?
   1a. The web page layout prior to any styling being applied
2. What are a few differences between `block-level` and `inline` elements? 
   2a. Block elements always start from a new line. Inline elements never start from a new line. Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element 
3. _______ positioning is the default for every html element.
   3a. Static positioning is the default for html elements
4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
   4a. Allows you to place any page element exactly where you want it. You use the positioning attributes top, left, bottom, and right to set the location. These values will be relative to the next parent element with relative (or absolute) positioning.
5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
   5a. A fixed position element is positioned relative to the browser window itself. A fixed positioned element will stay right where it is when the page is scrolled. Absolute positioning of elements are removed from the flow of elements on the page. An element with this type of positioning is not affected by other elements and it doesnâ€™t affect other elements.

### [Learn JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript){:target="_blank"}

[Functions -- Reusable Blocks of Code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions){:target="_blank"}

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
   1a.  The function declaration is writing the code for your function. At that point the function just sits there doing nothing. Function call or invocation is when you tell the JavaScript interpreter to run the code in your function.
2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
   2a. A parameter is a named variable passed into a function. Parameter variables are used to import arguments into functions. Function arguments are the real values passed to the function.

### Miscellaneous

   2. Talking through thought process - help to develop terminology and ready for technical interviews
