# Class 10 - Debugging and Error Handling

* [What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong)

* Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
  * A syntax error is an error in how the code is written in terms of syntax. For instance if characters are used incorrectly or out of sequence. A logic error is an error in the code that prevents the code from operating correctly. Perhaps a comparison or loop that is setup incorrectly. 
* List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
  * I've encountered several syntax errors, where I've forgotten to add a semi-colon or made a typo. Also logic errors when setting up loops. I was able to fix the errors by inspecting the console and making changes in my code. 
* How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
  * Knowing that there are many options to troubleshoot and log outcomes, this influences me to take risks, try new things because I can observe what's happening and adjust to get the outcome I want. 

## [The JavaScript Debugger](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_debugger)

* How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
  * The JavaScript debugger tool looks a little overwhelming for someone just starting out in software development. Although, I'm sure it is helpful to get immediate feedback from a tool and make adjustments. The console has been very helpful to test code snippets and learn as you go. 
* Define what a breakpoint is.
  * Breakpoint is a place in your code, where you want the execution to stop to allow you to examine the program data and/or state. It is used for debugging and set/removed by the debugger software.
* What is the call stack?
  * The call stack shows you what code was executed to get the current line.
