### [Introduction To Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events)

* How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?
  * notifications that take place to alert a user that a change is taking place, similar to how a washing machine changes from rinse cycle to spin cycle
* When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?
  * event name and the function to run when the event occurs
* Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?
  * Event objects are created when a user interacts with their browser. The event object properties are: type, target, path. The target is the destination of the event object, where the object can trigger the element and return. 
* What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?
  * Event bubbling and capturing are two ways of event propogation in HTML DOM API. Event propogatio mode determines in which order the elements receive the event. Bubbling the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propogated to out elements. With capturing, the event is first captured by the outermost element and propagated to the inner elements. "trickle down, bubble up"
